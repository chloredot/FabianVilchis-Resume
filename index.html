        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello there. My name is Fabian Vilchis and I am currently a 
        student at the University of California Riverside. I am an electrical engineering 
        major and really enjoy working with electronics. Once I graduate which should not 
        take me much more longer I am going to get a job as an aeronautics designer. I 
        really hope to get this career as it will mae me very happy and allow me to not only 
        have a job I really enjoy but also just have the money to pursue my other past times 
        that I have.<br><br>

        Even though I am an electrical engineering major I have not always been super into 
        electronics. It was almost at the time when I was going to apply to colleges that I 
        discovered that I really enjoyed learnijg about and messing with electronics. One of 
        the first encounters I had with the world of elctronics was when I fixed my heater. 
        The heater I had ended up falling and the safety switch was broken and would not let 
        it turn off so I had to take it apart and see what I could do about it. When first 
        opening it up I really did not plan to fix it as I did not know anyhting about fixing 
        electronics and I was also afraid of the electricity since I has always heard it could 
        kill you. I also knew that the heater used the strong electricity that could kill but 
        still I was curious. Ever since I was young I had been pretty hands on and have had 
        pretty crafty hobbies like fixing cars, woodworking, and just all around reapring 
        my broken things. Anyways, getting back to the heater. The main reason I decided to 
        open it up was just to take a look at it because I wanted to see how complex everything 
        was. After doing so I saw that it was not very complex at all and that gave me the 
        confidence to try to fix it. I began researching how electronics worked after that 
        and in two hours I had the heater partially fixed but this time without a safety switch 
        since it had broken. Even with this I was really glad to have at least partially 
        repaired it as it opened up a new hobby and one that i realized I really liked.<br><br>

        Ever since getting into UCR I have only continued to grow my understanding and 
        eperience with eelctronics. It has become one of my main hobbies since it allows 
        me to create and fix things and is a hands on hobby which I enjoy the most. I have 
        also gotten a job since then and with the money have bought electronics equipment 
        to help me build and fix electronics projects. I am really proud of having bought this 
        equipment as it allows me to make so many new things and I can even design much 
        more complex electronics. I will continue to upgrade my equpment as time goes on 
        and I gain more knowledge but for now I will continue hitting the books. I have also 
        taken an interest in the electronics of music so I am going to research those 
        electronics.
